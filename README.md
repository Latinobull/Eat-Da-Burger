Here is a project where you can see two different burgers where one is waiting to be devoured and one is already devoured. When the user press the "Devour Me" button, the burgers goes down to the Already Devoured box. If the user presses the "I've Been Devoured" button, then the burgers goes back into the For Devouring box.
